# WordHunt
Software Engineering Project in Spring 2015 at HEIG-VD (HES-SO)

WordHunt is a simple client-server game. It's intended as a project in Software Engineering course in Spring 2015 at HEIG-VD (School of Engineering Vaud - HES-SO University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland).

It provides a back-end Java server to generate games, a MySQL database to save games and user stats, an Android client to play the game and an administration panel.

WordHunt is NOT public during the semester, and we'll decide what happens to this project after the course is finished.
