# WordHunt
Software Engineering Project in Spring 2015 at HEIG-VD (HES-SO)

WordHunt is a simple client-server game. It's intended as a project in Software Engineering course in Spring 2015 at HEIG-VD (School of Engineering Vaud - HES-SO University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland).

It provides a back-end Java server to generate games, a MySQL database to save games and user stats, an Android client to play the game and an administration panel.

WordHunt was not public during the semester, and we have decided to make it open-source now that this project and the course are finished.

# Execute WordHunt
You can find the executable in the production folder (.jar for server, .apk for client). Don't forget to import the .sql file in your mySQL first. You can run the test in the Test folder to ensure everything is going well.
